---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile this program type "make" in the part2 directory
then type ./sched to run

once the program is running type progA<enter> progB<enter> progC<enter>

the program will cyle between the processes one at a time every 3 seconds. progA prints 'a' repeatedly
progB prints 'b' repeatedly and so on.

you can type the name of an executable to run as long as it is in the "exec" directory in part2

progA B and C are precompiled  and located in the exec directory for an example.
